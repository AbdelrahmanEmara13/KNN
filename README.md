# KNN
k-nearest neighbors algorithm

Implement a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier that uses the 80%-20% cross validation
approach for determining the best K value. Apply the classifier to the training data of the 26 lowercase characters provided in the file “Problem 2 Dataset.zip”. The zip file contains two folders:
“Noise Train” and “Noise Test”. The “Noise Train” folder contains 7 images for each lower-case
character while the “Noise Test” folder contains 2 images for each lower-case character. The images
in the “Noise Train” folder should be used in the cross validation. In your analysis, you should
examine 10 different 80%-20% datasets that are randomly determined. Use maximum K of 100.
